I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Time Series Forecasting
Time Series Forecasting refers to the analysis and modelling of time-series data. It aids in predicting the future behavior of the market, which is useful for every business's decision-making. When working on an issue involving time series forecasting, you need to know how to select a forecasting model.

The choice of the Time Series Forecasting model depends on the type of time series data you are working with. There are four types of time series data:
Stationary data
Data with trends
Seasonal data
Cyclical series data
